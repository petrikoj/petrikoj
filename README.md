### Hello world! üåê

I am a trained humanities guy with a professional background 
in social media who fell in love with the world of code.

Knowing that this is the field I want to pursue a career in, 
I took a five months fulltime course at [Code Academy Berlin](https://github.com/CodeAcademyBerlin) to
expand my personal stack by **React**, **Node.js**,
**MongoDB**, **GraphQL** and **Next.js**.

When working on the front end, I have a strong visual approach.
I enjoy using CSS frameworks and applied several of them in my
projects, such as **Chakra UI**, **Bulma** or **Material UI**.
